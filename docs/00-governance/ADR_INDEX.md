# Architecture Decision Register

**Status:** Active

---

## Purpose

This document indexes Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and related governance policies for the Telepizza ROS repository.

ADRs document significant architectural decisions that affect the long-term direction of the platform.

Detailed ADR markdown files, when authored, live under [`docs/13-adr/`](../13-adr/). Until an ADR file exists there, treat the index entries below as governance policy pointers, not as claims that a standalone ADR artifact is present.

## ADR Lifecycle

Every Architecture Decision follows the same lifecycle.

## When an ADR is Required

Create an ADR when changing:

- System architecture
- Database architecture
- Public APIs
- Authentication
- Security boundaries
- Shared libraries
- Module boundaries
- Repository governance
- Engineering standards

Routine implementation changes do **not** require an ADR.
